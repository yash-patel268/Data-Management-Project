# Data-Management-Project

This is the final project for the Data management course. Our choice this project was to make a clinic registration application to demostrate our knowledge of databases and how to work with them. The creation of this web application was done through the languages that include HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, XML, and SQL. 

## How to run the application

Inorder to run the application it is required to have WAMP Package. WAMP will allow the application to be hosted locally with databases. (Here is the link if the application isnt on your computer already: https://www.wampserver.com/en/)

### Setting up databases
After launching WAMP it must be noted that for this project the port server used is 3308 which was changed due to applications using the same port, this must be changed in the code to another port in each PHP file where its used or your port must be changed in WAMP. To change port for SQL right click on WAMP icon on tool bar, then click "MySQL", and changed the port used by MySQL.
